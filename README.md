# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb web application, focusing on the implementation of a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects through a shell. It supports various commands to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, as well as perform operations on them.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ ./console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands interactively. Here are some example commands:
(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) all
(hbnb) update User 1234-5678-9012 email "new.email@example.com"
(hbnb) quit
Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create State name="California"
(hbnb) show State
(hbnb) update State 1234-5678-9012 name "New York"
(hbnb) all
(hbnb) quit
